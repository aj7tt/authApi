This microservices-based project is centered around creating a robust user authentication and management system using RESTful APIs. It employs JWT tokens for secure authentication and ensures error handling through well-defined error responses. The system accommodates various authentication mechanisms, including:

User Login: Users can securely log in using their credentials, with options for both traditional username/password-based login (basic authentication) and more modern methods like passwordless login.

User Sign-Up: New users can create accounts, providing necessary information and credentials for authentication.

User Logout: Users have the ability to log out of their accounts securely.

Password Management: The system allows users to manage their passwords, including changing passwords, resetting forgotten passwords, or setting up multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.

User profiles are a central aspect of the system, and they are managed with role-based access control. This implies that different user roles, such as administrators and regular users, have varying permissions and capabilities within the system. User data is organized and stored efficiently, likely utilizing SQLAlchemy for database operations.

The technology stack powering this project includes FastAPI, a Python web framework known for its speed and simplicity, as well as JWT for secure token-based authentication. Additionally, communication services are integrated to handle one-time passwords (OTP) and facilitate multi-factor authentication. This might involve sending OTPs via email, SMS, or other communication channels.

Data integrity and security are maintained through secure hashing of passwords and robust encryption methods. The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the independent scaling of individual microservices to accommodate varying levels of usage. Overall, this system offers a comprehensive solution for managing user identities and access control within an application, including the core functionalities of login, sign-up, logout, and password management.
